To prevent which, there has been much thought employed of late, upon certain projects for taking off the force and edge of those formidable inquirers, from canvassing and reasoning upon such delicate points."", Tale of atub, Begins: ""Whoever hath an ambition to be heard in a crowd, must press, and squeeze, and thrust, and climb, with indefatigable pains, till he has exalted himself to a certain degree of altitude behind them.

The controversy took its rise from an essay of Sir William Temple's upon that subject; which was answered by W.

She is projecting before him a woman being pulled between two men. Underneath the projected scene is written, ""Poor France!"" The man who is watching the scene is writing something while the woman behind him is very animated and there are clouds surrounding her., Chapter 1 - One of my days; Chapter 2 - The Next Day; Chapter 3 - The Next Week; Chapter 4 - The Man for Conspiracies; Chapter 5 - The Mustaches; Chapter 6 - The Man for Principles; Chapter 7 - The Man for a Salad; Chapter 8 - The Sovereign; Chapter 9 - The Man for Pirouettes; Chapter 10 - I begin to be infected; Chapter 11 - My Hallucinations; Chapter 12 - Events, There are several drawings following the explanatory note on the engravings. The first drawing depicts a man looking with disgust at some stick-like instrument topped with the head of a joker. Underneath the drawing is written, ""They must be hanged"" and the artist is James Shury. The second drawing depicts a man sitting down and kind of crouching in fear of this disembodied hand coming out from the empty space above the poor guy. The hand looks like it means to pick something off the man. The description of the drawing is, ""Don't you see those two great fingers ready to pinch my nose?"" The third drawing is depicts a man with an eye patch. He is missing his right arm and looks glum. The title of this drawing is, ""We shall devour five or six kings more."" The fourth drawing shows a man holding a stick topped with the head of a hoker and flexing his arm so as to strike at the air where there is a projected scene of people fighting in some war. The description reads, ""The Robbers will then rush in amidst the Ruins, each with a dagger in one hand and a firebrand in the other... They will bathe themselves in our blood, they will gorge themselves with our spoils."" The fifth image shows a man approaching a stick topped with the head of a joker who is apparently blowing something into the air. The description reads, ""I salute thee O Wind!"" The characters in all five drawings are depicted alongside a stick topped with the head of a joker. Only the sixth and last drawing does not include this joker head stick. The last scene shows a man in between two other men whose wrists he is grasping. The man in the middle looks happy while the other two men look mad. The description reads, ""You must love each other like brothers.","Preface, Table of contents, Explanatory Note, Postscript, Note, Advertisement","Begins: ""The French press is continually teeming withh a variety of literary works, by men of talents, upon alll subjects, which, for the moment, amuse and are admired. Few of them are sufficiently interesting to foreigners to be translated; yet some pass unnoticed, which, both for their information and style, deserve attention, and would gratify the general reader. The following is a translation of one that appears likely to interest the British public; for, not only at this period, but  at all times, in an historical as well as relative point of view, the affairs of France must be of importance to all civilized nations, and peculiarly to Great Britain. This volume, from the pen of a writer greatly esteemed in his own country, gives a view of the political state of France, of its parties, of the natural tendency of the age to the general interests of mankind, and of the ultimate object of civilization in its silent progress towards universal good., Ends: The measures understood by the Laws of Exceptions are ordinances thought necessary on particular occasions, such as those for preventing or suppressing publications and others the power of which was established by the Chambers of 1815., There are 12 chapters, as well as Postscript and Notes.

One reflection consoles me, and that is, that I have not scandalized your heart. In all the extravagances I have placed before you, you have found nothing to warrant your denying me esteem, or to induce you to hate me., Ends: ""I will entertain you in future only with things of a real nature, and which you may make use of.

W. Davis, Clerk of the District of Massachusetts., Begins: ""The following selection is intended for the use of common country schools, and is designed chiefly for the use of scholars in the first and second classes. The Compiler has long been impressed with the idea that the generality of reading books put into the hands of scholars did not fully answer the purposes intended.. The authors have consulted their own taste rather than the capacities of children, and the selections, where they do not degenerate into childishness and vulgarit, are of too high a cast for the comprehension of the youthful mind."", Begins: ""It is presumed that those who undertake the arduous duty of instructing children in the first principles of education, are, in regard both to morals and learning, suitably qualified and properly recommended. It is not a light or unimportant business upon which they have entered, but one requiring much labor, and involving great responsibility. The habits, manners, and principles of the youth committed to their care, depend in no small degree upon their instructions and example, and the future usefulness of the scholar in society is closely connected with the ability and faithfulness of his early teacher.... The following directions will, therefore, apply to the management of the school in its exercises, and are given to assist the youthful teacher in the discharge of his duty, and to enable him, by establishing a plan of order  and regularity, to perform his labors with the greatest ease to himself and benefit to his scholars."", There are nine points!, Begins: ""The two first, and indeed principle qualifications necessary to form a good reader are voice and judgement. A defrect in the former may indeed be partially remedied by unweared application and industry, but a defect in the latter will inevitably prove fatal to improvement. To cultivate this therefore, should be the great and leading object with every instructor, and the effect to be produced is not so much to be gained from written rules as from living example."", There are 11 rules., Ends: ""We shall close these rules and observations by a remark of considerable importance to young persons who are desirous of learning to read well. Few rules on the subject are intelligible to children, unless illustrated by the voice of a competent instructor. They should, therefore, pay great attention to the manner in which their teacher and other persons of approved skill perform the business of reading. They should observe their mode of pronouncing the words, placing the emphasis, making the pauses, managing the voice, and adapting it to the various subjects they read; and in all these respects endeavor to imitate them as nearly as possible."", There are 102 chapters., The book ends with a prayer to God.",0,Third-person,Verse,Dramatic Dialogue,0,0,,,"Reader, Variety, Pieces, use, schools, improvement, scholars, classes, art, reading","Common, Consisting, Original",,T.

341331,"Fénelon, François de Salignac de La Mothe-,",1651-1715.,"The adventures of Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, king of Ithaca, &c. in Greece, and one of the princes who conducted the siege of Troy. Complete in twenty-four books. Originally written in French, not only for the use and instruction of the dauphin of France, to guard him, in an allegorical way, against forming his conduct after the bad example of his grandfather Louis XIV, but also to promote the happiness of mankind in general; by Francis Salignac de la Motte Fenelon, late archbishop of Cambray, in the French Netherlands. Now newly translated from the best Paris and other editions, by William Henry Melmoth, esq. Author of the new abridgment of the Roman history-of the complete abridgment of the Grecian history-and of the new universal story-teller, or modern picture of human life; being an approved collection of original and select pieces in prose and verse.-Price 3s. each bound. To which are added, the life of the original author; the heads and arguments of each book at large; and a great variety of notes, historical, critical, explanatory, scholastic, political, moral, philological, satirical, and illustrative: comprehending the most salutary reflections and remarks, with allusions to ancient mythology, geography, and universal history, particularly to the histories of England and France:-A work of the first reputation, replete with maxims of human prudence, and including the most perfect system of morality ever presented to the world, displaying to all descriptions of persons the horrors of vice, and the charms of virtue, in the most forcible manner. The mysteries of the wisest and best politics are here developed: the inordinate passions are depicted as a yoke equally disgraceful and fatal; while the moral duties appear with all the attractions of ease and beauty. The reasoning is just, the precepts are important. It is a work which genius and learning have dedicated to virtue; it at once captivates the imagination, informs the understanding, and regulates the will. This valuable book teaches us to make morality and religion our guide in good, as well as in adverse fortune; never to forget the love we owe our parents and our country. It forms our minds for a king, a citizen, a father, a mother, a master, a gentleman, a tradesman, a servant, and even a slave, if such should be our lot; and, in short, teaches us to act properly in all the various spheres of life. Mentor (under which character is meant Minerva) in his counsels to Telemachus, must make us just, humane, patient, sincere, discreet, and modest. He never speaks but he pleases, engages, moves, and persuades. We cannot attend to him but with admiration; and, in proportion as we admire, we cannot help loving his advice, which is entertaining as well as instructive. This translation has been carefully revised with all the former editions, and particular attention has been paid to the various readings of Hawkesworth, Smollett, Boyer, Litterbury, Oldes, Ozell, and others, entirely omitting their inaccuracies and blemishes, and preserving whatever we judged might elucidate the great design the author had in view when he composed this work, viz. of promoting the happiness of his noble pupil in particular, and of the world in general.

Every thing, that he undertakes has somewhat of the marvellous belonging to it [Here, suggests that readers can identify what is ""marvellous"" or what we might now call fictional--a bit larger than life, yet believably real--but do not fully recognize the work as fiction because of prefatory legitimacy claims]. In this Rome opens her bosom to him, and discovers all her treasures; in his Paysanne Parvenue* [Footnote: *A celebrate Novel of the same Author's, that has been miserably murder'd, under the Title of the Fortunate Country Maid.], a Marchioness of the first rank, intrusts him with her secrets; and in his Mentor a-la-Mode, he entertains us with analogies, which have never been though on by any body but himself: And, the first opportunity, he will palm upon us, with the same confidence, some new flights of his imagination, and will give us to understand, that they are to have the greater regard paid to them, on account of some such mystery miraculously brought to light. Such are the censures I must expect from them [who is ""them""? readers? critics?]: What, then, must I do in this cafe? I cannot compel them to believe me; nothing is more free than thought; and were I in their stead, perhaps, I should say more. The publick are to be our judge; and, to pass sentence on all the works of nature: Were I desirous of pre-possessing them in my favour, I would here make an encomium upon their equity; but what would this avail me? I should acquaint them with nothing new, and they would not be a jot the less severe in their criticisms. As for falling upon my knees and asking their pardon, in a preface, as a learned man* [Footnote: *Monsieur Boileau.] says upon this head, I am their very humble servant; and renounce their favour, at this mortifying price. But let us leave vain reflections; frequently arising from the pleasure of talking of one's self; which is a vanity common to almost all authors: let us endeavour not to imitate them, and return to our subject."", Provides narrative of the history of this manuscript: how it was first found under the foundations of a house in Rome by a mason and eventually ended up in Paris, where it was sold to the translator, Explains that the manuscript was in Italian but to the ""surprize"" of the translator, ""the scene laid at Paris"", Explains editorial practices: ""I did not think it material to alter the false names that are assumed therein, because that was of no great importance; but, as there are some satyrical passages, against persons in power, at the time when it was written, and the scene being laid at Paris, some persons might have made false applications thereof, I have omitted them, as well as several monstrous, and extraordinary stories, hardly to be believ'd, and too differnet from the customs of these times."", Promotes the text rather that humbly offering/submitting it to the readers, which was the ""fashion of the day"" as described in the preface to vol. I: ""We do not pretend here to make an apology for this second volume; but we cannot help giving our readers notice, that the incidents, wherewith it abounds, are sufficiently affect, and the descriptions sufficiently lively, to be read with some eagerness."", Sets out a model for critical and complete reading, while suggesting that a book can only be as instructive or useful as the reader allows it: ""What we said, about the earnestness, wherewith it is usual to peruse any book of amusement, is, to induce our readers not to be like a man, whose voracious appetite makes him eat his victuals without chewing it [...]. Consideration is the palate, which tastes and digests the sentiments which fall in its way; and the longer they remain impress'd upon the mind, the more advantage we derive from thence; it is not enough to read what is agreeable with pleasure, we ought not to forget what is useful."", Borges and Gerard Genette were not the first to analogize paratext to vestibules/entryways: ""This is what we thought necessary to premise, in relation to our first volume, and we hope, together with the perusal of this, will be a full answer to all that has been alledged aobut it; we shall not, therefore, detain our readers any longer in the porch, but refer them to the parts following, which will enable them to judge for themselves.",0,First-person,Letters,,0,0,,,"Busy-body, Spy, History, Mons., Man, Rashness, Faculty, Obscurity, Fortune, Story, Whole, Variety, Adventure, Vol.","Successful, Entertaining, Infinitely, Inquisitive, Enterprising, Unhappy, Lowest, Most, Splendid, Several, Humorous, Great, Equally, Instructive, Diverting",,Mons.

I never read them, and why should I write them? They stand like pales about a park; I always overleap them, if I am told there is any thing, within, worth seeing. But, what can I do? I am likely to lead a fine life with this performance, when people begin to quarrel with me, upon reading the first word, of the first page, of my work.""), Authorial voice speaks to readers, as in dedication (e.g. ""Here then, begin.

Imitation is natural to the human mind.

Middle Temple, August 5, 1783."", Explains necessity of preface for this work: to explain certain characters and events which may at first appear to stand against virtue and morality (e.g. ""It was not till I had read this book in print, that I thought about a preface; but, on reviewing it, prior to publication, I am convinced a preface is absolutely necessary. In the course of these volumes, it is possible the reader may meet with some sentiments, which, at first sight, seem unfavourable to the interests of virtue, and to the laws of moral life. As the direct contrary is all along intended to be strongly inculcated, I beg those who think proper to turn over my pages...to go calmly on, forbearing to pass judgment till they have fairly seen the whole of my arguments.""), Directly discusses purpose of satirical/critical statements which accompany chapter headings in table of contents (e.g. ""It is necessary to say something for having prefixed a table of contents to these volumes...it is not only customary to give short introductory summaries, but it was even whispered to the editor, by several gentle readers, that such pithy hints at the head of a chapter were not only agreeable, and convenient, but even honest and conscientious in an author...""), Advises reader to read whole work instead of using prefatory material as judge of work (e.g. ""...a great deal more will be found in every chapter, than can, or indeed ought to be told, at the top: and therfore it is my serious and earnest advice, as a fair-dealing editor, between author and reader, that...the whole should be read through with candour.""), Describes how and why story has changed over the editions (e.g. ""The History of Benignus is, in these volumes* [*Alluding to the two last, as they appeared at the first publication.], brought to such a peirod as sufficiently enforces the moral intended to be deduced from it. The laws of romance, novel, and comedy, might require a different catastrophe: for in those, it is too often the custom...to croud the last scene with persons married, or murdered, to the novel-reader's satisfaction. But the laws of narrative ought to be less rigid, and, I flatter myself, the reader will forgive my adhering, upon this occasion, to human nature, even though I verge against the formalities of literary custom. The former portions of the work contain many of those dialogues, conversation-pieces, and characters, which fell, necessarily, in the way of our emigrating author in his romantic ramble after happiness. But now, as he advances farther into society, a greater variety of events and opinions...present themselves: to which have been generally added, the adventurer's reflections, upon peculiar scenes, as they figured before him.""), Asks readers to differentiate between character of work and character of author/publisher/editor (e.g. ""Both the editor and the author have, already, entered a caveat against being accountable for the vice or depravity of any of the characters. Who ever thought of charging Shakespeare with immorality, for having drawn an Iago; Fielding, a Blisil; or Richardson, a Lovelace?""), Explains why former prefaces are included in this edition: to show the reader how and why the work has been edited over the various editions (e.g. ""I shall detain the reader with preliminaries no longer, than just to inform him, all the former prefaces are admitted into this edition, because they may be considered as so many defences of the work, in the progress of its original publication.""), Short, ""pithy"" description appends each chapter heading",0,First-person,Letters,Poems,0,0,,,"Opinion, History, Edition, Volume, Mr.","Liberal, New, Corrected",,"Mr. Pratt, Benignus",,,,AFD 06/27/2011,,,,

Nevertheless, as the sale of these is not certain; and if I should find it an expense, rather than a profit, to proceed in the work, I may quit it, and fall foul of the public measures, those who discharge the public trust, at the present time, may not be altogether safe. It were, therefore, wise policy in such, to assist the sale as much as possible; and it might not be amiss, in the first instance, to buy up, each of them, a number of copies. I do not know that I have any thing to say of the president of the United States; or that I would say it, if I had; nevertheless, it might not be amiss for him, on the principle of preservation, and agreeably to that universal prudence he has ever shewn, to take a few; perhaps fifty might suffice. [...] As to the Congress that have sat since the adoption of the federal constitution, they need not put themselves to the expence, individually or collectively of purchasing one pamphlet; as I am determined not to be bought off by them; but in a work which I shall by and by publish will canvas, freely, the respective demerit of their votes."", ""Proceeding with my object : the giving an example of a perfect stile in writing, I come now to the second volume of the work."", In defense of his own style, champions a ""natural"", universally-relatable performance which succeeds in its imperfections, rather than betraying itself as an overwrought construction by perscriptive style: ""I well know, that it will not all at once, and by all persons, be thought to be the model of  aperfect stile, for it is only the perfectly instructed, and delicately discerning that can discover its beauties;: and perhaps none will be more apt to pass them by than the learned of the academies, versed in grammar rule sof writing; for there is a greeness in the judgment of the school critics with respect to what is simple and natural in composition. To illustrate this by analogy. Let a dancing master pass his judgment on the movements of the best bred man in life; and not finding in his position and attitudes, an evident conformity to the lessons of the saltatory art, he will conclude that he has not been taught to move with propriety. He does not know that it is this very cirumstance that constitutes the excellence of the movements of the easy and perfeclty genteel man; to wit, that when you observe him, it will never once come into your mind that he thinks of his attitudes or positions in the least; but that every movement is just as it happens, and without any intention on his part. Ars est celare artem It is the secret of good taste and perfection in behaviour to conceal that you ever think of it at all. [...] the most perfect proof of a good stile, that when you read the composition, you think of nothing but the sense; and are never struck with the idea that it is otherwise expressed than every body would express it."", Includes an excerpt from a critical review (most likely written by Brackenridge himself, but I recommend confirming whether this was indeed an independtly publisched critical review): ""I am happy to find that in the review o fthis publication, by the critics, my ideas of the merit of the stile, is recognized, and fully justified. And as my work may be well supposed, to have a much more extensive circulation, and to live longer than miscellaneous performances, I have thought it not amiss, for the honor of the critics to extract some part of the observations which have been made by them, and which are as follows: '[...] IN the present work which he entitles Modern Chivalry, he disowns the idea of any moral or sentiment whatsoever, and proposes stile only as the object of the composition. And to this object, in our opinion, he scrupulously adheres; for though on some occasions, there would seem to be a semblance of idea, yet this we must attribute to the imagination o the reader..."", Abruptly cuts itself after the lengthly critical review: ""But this will suffice for an introduction.

This is, perhaps, unfortunate,--the tendency of the public taste seeming to require of American authors that they should confine themsevles to what is, in subject, event, and character, indigenous ot their own hemisphere; although such a requisition would end in reducing their materials to such a stock as might be carried about in a nut-shell. America is part of the great world, and, like other parts, has little (that is, suited to the purposes of fiction) which it can call exclusively its own; and how far that little has already been used up, any one may tell, who is conversant with our domestic literature. Some little, however, of that little yet remains; and, by and by, we will perhaps ourselves join in the general scramble after it."", Concludes with an appreciation of the Delaware Water-Gap.",1,Third-person,,,1,0,,"Calavar, The infidel","Hawk, Tradition, Author, Volume",Two,"Hawk-hollow, Pennsylvania",,,,,LCP HSP in LCP Am 1835 Bir Vt 1261,,,,

'Oh love! no habitatn of earth thou art--An unseen seraph, we believe in thee, A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart; But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see The naked eye, they form, as it should be; The mind hath made thee, as it people Heaven, Even with its own desiring phantasy, And to a thought, such shape and image given, As haunts the unquenched soul--parch'd--wearied--wrong--and rive.' Byron. In conformity to the act of Congress of the United States, entitled 'An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned;' and also, to the act entitled, 'An act supplementary to an act, entitled 'An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies during the times therein mentioned,' and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving and etching historical and other prints.' Richard R. Lansing, Cleark of the Northern District of New York."", Nearly completely transcription, in which the author quotes a defense of the romantic novel first published in New Monthly Magazine: ""With regard to the morality of writing or reading works of imagination, the author has been also under some doubts; but as the principle of philanthropy must commence its expanding influence in the heart, by breaking up the disposition which contracts all its interest upon self, and as these characters are inaccissble to moral lectures, and to the claims of real and passing events, if ever they come to know the happiness of being carried beyond the range of emotion within themselves, and elevated to a perception of grandeur and beauty, which, there, they must forever have remained strangers to, ti must be by being taken at unawares by romantic pictures of fictious suffering, of ideal beauty, and disinterested heroism; very inferior, indeed, to that sympahty which inspires real self-sacrifice, but better far than wholly to be ignorant of the joy of natural tears.. 'If novels (says a writer in the New Monthly Magainze, to whom I am indebted for some of the preceeding ideas) are not the deepest teachers of humanity, they have, at least, the widest range. They lend to genius 'lighter wings to fly.' They are read where Milton and Shakspeare are only talked of, and even where their names are never heard. They nestle gently beneath the covers of unconscious sofas; are read by fair and glistening eyes, in moments snatched from repose; and beneath counters and shopboards, minister delights, secret, sweet and precious. It is possible that in particular instances their effects may be baneful; but, on the whole, we are persuaded they are good. The world is not in danger of becoming too romantic. The golden threads of poesy are not too thickly or too closely interwoven with the ordinary web of existence. Sympathy is the first great lesson which man should learn. It will be ill for him if he proceed no farther; if his emotions are but excited to roll back on his heart, and to be fostered in luxurious quite. But unless he learns to feel tenderly and deeply for things in which he has no personal interest, he can achieve nothing generous or noble. This lesson is in reality of all excellent. How mistaken are those miserable reasoners who object to them as giving false pictures of life—of purity too glossy and etherial—of friendship too deep and confiding—of love which does not shrink at the approach of ill, but ‘looks on tempests and is never shaken,’ because with these the world too rarely blossoms! Were these things visionary and unreal, who would break the spell, and bid the delicious enchantment vanish? The soul will not be the worse for believing that the highest excellence is within the reach of its exertions but these things are not unreal; they are shadows indeed, in themselves, but they are shadows cast from objects stately, grand and eternal. Man can never imagine that which has no foundation in his nature.' The above quotation is made, not because it applies in this particular place, in a preface to a work which scarcely makes a feeble effort to soar above the most ordinary probabilities, and the ruggedness of which is unsmoothed by either distance of time or place; but because this book, if read at at all, will be read by those who have not been in the habit of indulging their intellectual appetite with such kind of stimuli.",1,Third-person,Letters,,1,0,,,Tale,Narrative,Adsonville,,"Marry, Marry out",,,LCP Rare Am 1824 Hull 69926.D 1,,,,

Published under the pseudonym of Diedrich Knickerbocker, Irving's A History of New York was a mock heroic account of the New Amsterdam Dutch, but also a satire of President Jefferson's administration. Gift of Pamela G. Reilly."", Brief synopses at chapters' beginnings.","Copyright statement, Dedication, About the author, Preface, Note","This Work is respectfully Dedicated, as a humble and unworthy Testimony of the profound veneration and exalted esteem of the Society's Sincere Well wisher and Devoted Servant."", Signed ""Diedrich Knickerbocker."", First-person account of ""the author"" Knickerbocker, signed ""the public's humble servant, Seth Handaside."" A story of the work's coming to publication as, so to speak, it has: ""a true statement of my reasons for having this work printed, without waiting for the consent of the author."", ""It was sometime, if I recollect right, in the early part of the Fall of 1808, that a stranger [later identified as Knickerbocker] applied for lodgings at the Independent Columbian Hotel in Mulberry Street [New York], of which I am landlord."", ""He [Knickerbocker] would keep in his room for days together, and if any of the children cried or made a noise about his door, he would bounce out in a great passion, with his hands full of papers, and say something about 'deranging his ideas,' which made my wife believe sometimes that he was not altogether compos."", About two month's [sic] ago, he [Knickerbocker] went out of a morning, with a bundle in his hand--and has never been heard of since....My wife no said it was high time to...see if he had left any thing behind in his room."" The two find the manuscript of A History of New York and, upon a librarian friend's suggestion, arrange it published. ""Upon this we got a very learned school-master...to prepare it for the press, which he accordingly has done, and has moreover, added to it a number of notes of his own, and an engraving of the city, as it was, at the time Mr. Knickerbocker writes about."", Opens with a quote, attributed to ""Belce's Herodotus"" via footnote: ""To rescue from oblivion the memory of former incidents, and to render a just tribute of renown to the many great and wonderful transactions of our Dutch progenitors, Diedrich Knickerbocker, native of the city of New York, produces this historical essay."", ""Determined...to avert if possible this threatening misfortune [""the origin of our city will be buried in eternal oblivion""], I industriously sat myself to work, to gather together all the fragments of our infant history which still existed, and like my revered prototype Herodotus, where no written records could be found, I have endeavoured to continue the chain of history by well authenticated traditions."", Claims to source materials: ""Strange as it may seem...there are no...extant [works] which give any full and satisfactory account of the early history of New York, or of its three first Dutch governors. I have, however, gained much valuable and curious matter from an elaborate manuscript written in exceeding pure and classic low dutch, excepting a few errors in orthography, which was found in the archives of the Stuyvesant family.  Many legends, letters and other documents have I likewise gleaned, in my researches among the family chests and lumber garrets of our respectable dutch citizens, and I have gathered a host of well authenticated traditions from divers [sic] excellent old ladies of my aquaintance, who requested that their names might not be mentioned."" Scandalous. ""Nor must I neglect to acknowledge, how greatly I have been assisted by that admirable and praiseworthy institution, the New York Historical Society, to which I here publicly return my sincere acknowledgements."", Claims to ""being"" a historian and ""doing"" history: ""I have adopted no individual model, but on the contrary have simply contented myself with combining and concentrating the excellencies of the most approved ancient historians."" These historians are identified as Xenophon, Sallust, Thucydides, Tacitus, Livy, and Herodotus. The author (the preface is unsigned) intends to create a synthetic account, but has found such compilation difficult given the variously obscure origins of ""the facts herein recorded,"" personified in ""the infant years of our city"" as, e.g., ""literary voluptuaries."" ""But I have scrupulously discarded many a pithy tale and marvelous adventure, whereby the drowsy ear of summer indolence might be enthralled; jealosly maintaining that fidelity, gravity and dignity, which should ever distinguish the historian."" The message: trust the author. ""For after all, gentle reader, cities of themselves, and in fact empires of themselves, are nothing without an historian....The world--the world, is nothing without the historian!"" Alternately, an ironic alert to readers about the pseudoethnographical nature of the work: for ""it is the patient narrator who cheerfully records their prosperity as they rise--who blazons for the splendour [sic] of their noontide meridian--who props their feeble memoirals as they totter to decay--who gathers together their scattered fragments as they rot--and who piously at length collects their ashes into the mausoleum of his work, and rears a triumphal monument, to transmit their renown to all succeeding time."", Adresses critics and others: ""Oh! ye mighty Whales, ye Grampuses and Sharks of criticism, who delight in shipwrecking unfortunate adventurers upon the sea of letters, have mercy upon this my crazy vessel. Ye may toss it about in your sport; or spout your dirty water upon it in showers; but do not, for the sake of the unlucky mariner within--do not stave it with your tails and send it to the bottom. And you, oh ye great little fish! ye tadpoles, ye sprats, ye minnows, ye chubbs, ye grubs, ye barnacles, and all you small fry of literature, be cautious how you insult my new launched vessel, or swim within my view; lest in a moment of mingled sportiveness and scorn, I sweep you up in a scoop net, and roast half a hundred of you for my breakfast."", Footnotes, Attributed to ""a very learned school-master"" in paratextual ""about the author"" essay (""Account of the Author"").",1,First-person,,Verse,1,0,,,"History, Beginning, World, End, Dynasty, Matter, Pondering, Project, Achievment [sic], Achievement, Governor, History, Time, Volume","Dutch, Many, Surprising, Curious, Unutterable, Disastrous, Chivalric, Three, Dutch, Only, Authentic, Two","New York, New Amsterdam","Walter the Doubter, William the Testy, Peter the Headstrong, Diedrich Knickerbocker","Contain, Be, Publish",,,r 2 010923 x a -,,,,

He is the more encouraged in this enterprise, by a belief that the American public is beginning to awaken from the apathy which which our native writers have heretofore been regarded, and that our countryment are now willing to bestow upon native genius, some of the patronage which has been lavished with indiscriminate profusion upon undeserving foreigners. A number of the tales in this volume have already been published, but some of them appeared several years ago, and are now forgotten: and while a few have had the advantage of extensive circulation in popular periodicals, others have not been thus favoured. It is thought therefore, that they will be sufficiently novel to most readers, and desirable to the friends of the author, to warrant the collection of them in a volume. It will be seen that they are strictly American.

He rambled about his own country and had he ""been merely a lover of fine scenery [he] should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere for its gratification...for on no country [than America] have the charms of nature been more prodigally lavished.

The narrator answers back, ""That there is no situation in life but has its disadvantages and pleasures, provided we will but take a joke as we find it: That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troppers, is likely to have rough riding of it: Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress, is a certain step to high preferment in the state.""

However, ""I am not...for those barefaced tales which carry their moral on the surface....On the contrary, I have often hid my moral from sight, and disguised it as much as possible by sweets and spices, so that while the simple reader is listening with open mouth to a ghost or a love story, he may have a bolus of sound morality popped down his throat, and be never the wiser for the fraud."", Source claims: ""The Adventure of the German Student, or rather the latter part of it, is founded on anecdote related to me as existing somewhere in French; and, indeed, I have been told, since writing it, that an ingenious tale has been founded on it by an English writer; but I have never met with either the former or the latter in print. Some of the circumstances in the Adventure of the Mysterious Picture, and in the Story of the Young Italian, are vague recollections of anecdotes related to me some years since; but from what source derived I do not know. The Adventure of the Young Painter among the banditti is taken almost entirely from an authentic narrative in manuscript.""

Now""--explicit interparatextuality--""I protest I never met with any adventure of the kind. I should not have grieved at this, had it not been intimated by the author of Waverly [Sir Walter Scott], in an introduction to his novel of Peveril of the Peak, that he was himself the stout gentleman alluded to. I have ever since been importuned by questions and letters from gentlemen, and particularly from ladies without number, touching what I had seen of the Great Unknown. Now all this is extremely tantalising. It is like being congratulated on the high prize when one has drawn a blank; for I have just as great a desire as any one of the public to penetrate the mystery of that very singular personage, whose voice fills every corner of the world, without any one being able to tell from whence it comes."" A story related in which Sir Walter Scott, ""the Stout Gentleman,"" is either seen or not seen by the nervous gentleman: ""The features he had caught a glimpse of seem common to the whole race of stout gentlemen, and the Great Unknown remains as great an unknown as ever."", ""Having premised these circumstances, I will now let the nervous gentleman proceed with his stories.--"", ""Part II.

This work is dedicated, in testimony of the admiration and affection of the author."", First sentence reads: The following writings are published on experiment; should they please, they may be followed by others., Preface states that author is ""unsettled in his abode, subject to interruptions, and has his share of cares and vicissitudes. He cannot, therefore, promise a regular plan, nor regular periods of publication."" He will be writing ""sometimes...of scenes before him, sometimes of others purely imaginary, and sometimes wandering back with his recollections to his native country."" Though he does not have time to write to perfection, ""should his writings,...with all his imperfections, be well received, he cannot conceal that it would be a source of purest gratification...it is the dearest wish of his heart to have a secure and cherished, though humble corner in the good opinions and kind feelings of his countrymen."", First sentence reads: The following desultory papers are part of a series written in this country, but published in America., The author states that his papers were published in America and may only be interesting in the eyes of American readers. ""He has, however, observed several of them from time to time inserted in periodical works of merit, and has understood, that it was probable they would be re-published in a collective form."" He wishes that if his story be ""deemed of sufficient importance to attract the attention of critics, he solicits for them that courtesy and candour which a stranger has some right to claim who presents himself at the threshold of a hospitable nation"" even though British critics treat American writings with austerity., Includes epigraph from Euphues by John Lyly: ""I am of this mind with Homer, that as the snaile that crept out of her shel was turned eftsoones into a toad, and thereby was forces to make a stoole to sit on; so the traveller that stragleth from his owne country is in a short time transformed into so monstrous a shape, that he is faine to alter his mansion with his manners, and to live where he can, not where he would."", First sentence reads: I was always fond of visiting new scenes, and observing strange characters and manners., Author notes how he had always been fascinated by traveling, even sauntering around his native city when he was young. He rambled about his own country and had he ""been merely a lover of fine scenery [he] should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere for its gratification...for on no country [than America] have the charms of nature been more prodigally lavished. But Europe held forth all the charms of storied and poetical association."", Footnotes interspersed throughout stories, noted by astericks., Preface to story Rip Van Winkle, First sentence reads: The following tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker, an old gentleman of New-York, who was very curious in the Dutch history of the province, and the manners of the descendants from its primitive settlers., Preface describes Diedrich Knickerbocker's work, stating that he studied Dutch history through folklore. His stories are said to be ""admitted into all historical collections, as a book of unquestionable authority."" Preface ends with sentiment that D.K's memory is still ""held dear among many folk, whose good opinion is well worth having; particularly certain bisquit bakers, who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their new year cakes, and have thus given him a chance for immortality, almost equal to being stamped on a Waterloo medal, or a Queen Anne's farthing."", First sentence reads: The foregoing tale, one would suspect, had been suggested to Mr. Knickerbocker by a little German superstition about the Emperor Frederick der Rothbart and the Kypphauser mountain; the subjoined note, however, which he had appended to the tale, shows that it is an absolute fact, narrated with his usual fidelity."", Basically the note states that ""the story...is beyond the possibility of doubt."", Note between ""Christmas"" segment and ""Little britain"": ""The following modicum of local history was lately put into my hands by an odd-looking gnetleman [...] I confess that I was a little dubious at first, whether it was not one of those apocryphal tales [...] On making proper inquiries, however, I have received the most satisfactory assurances of the author's probity [...]"", Postscript to The legend of sleepy hollow., First sentence reads: The preceding tale is given, almost in the precise words in which I heart it related at a corporation meeting of the ancient city of the Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers., Postscript tells of a grave old man who asks the narrator of the story what the moral of the story was. The narrator answers back, ""That there is no situation in life but has its disadvantages and pleasures, provided we will but take a joke as we find it: That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troppers, is likely to have rough riding of it: Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress, is a certain step to high preferment in the state."" The old man accepts but still casts doubt on one or two points, at which point the narrator replies, ""as to that matter, I don't believe one half of it myself."", First sentence reads: In concluding a second volume of the Sketch book, the author cannot but express his deep sense of the indulgence with which his first has been received, and of the liberal disposition that has been evinced to treat him with kindness as a stranger., The author notes that though he has recieved many bits and pieces of advice from various readers about how/what to write about in his second volume. He found himself in a stand still until he realized ""that his work being miscellaneous, and written for different humours, it could not be expected that any one would be pleased with the whole; but that if it should contain something to suit each reader, his end would be completely answered.""

The difficulty is only increased in works of fiction that are founded on the customs of America, when a writer attempts to graft the scions of the imagination, on the stock of history....Besides the familiarity of the subject, there is a scarcity of events, and a poverty in the accompaniments, that drives an author from the undertaking in despair....In short, all that glow, which can be given to a tale, through the aid of obscure legends, artificial distinctions, and images connected with the association of the ideas is not attainable in this land of facts. Man is not the same creature here as in other countries.

I am now called upon by both those virtues to offer you this volume of hte Chinese letters, with a preference to all other persons to whom I might have dedicated it. I don't forget how you contributed to the success of my Jewish letters, nor the good reception which the publick gave to the epistolary address that I made to you at the head of the second volume."", Posthumously addresses and elegizies the King of Corsica, particularly addressing the publication of posthumous false memoirs: ""Above all, don't lay any stres supon the praises of those who extoll'd you to the skies when you were in your glory; for they hoped then that the praises would have turned to their advantage. They commended you in hsort to promot the vent of their works; but now they would, for the same reason, find fault with you, as you may quess from what has been lately said by a certain writer of Cologne, who after having mad eyou the author, in imagination, fo the finest deeds that ever were done, has metamorphosed you all on a sudden into a bad historian."", Signed ""I am your deceased majesty's most humble, &c. M. D***."", Printed in italics [to suggest translation?], Discuss differences in literary, religious, and philosophical practices betwen the European and the Chinese: ""What I have supposed the Chinese writers of these letters to be very well instructed in the learning of the Europeans, is not shocking to probability; for I admit them to have had a long intimacy with the missionary jesuits, and I know that they have cultivated an aquaintance with several English merchants at Pekin, by whose means they have read the best European books for above ten years past. If it not be thought extraordinary that in certain pieces even the dead are sometimes introduced as speakers, can there ben any harm in supposing certain Chinese, in fictitious letters, to be perhaps a little more learned than they are in reality? And tho' I have represented almost all my Chinese correspondents as very staunch Deists; yet i don't pretend to decide the notable dispute which has subsisted for so long a time, between several learned Europeans, whether the men of learning incline rather to atheism than deism."", Quotes Leibnitz's Letters. tome ii. p. 415, Includes a footnote, which glosses a theory of M. de la Croze that aligns Chinese and ancient Egyptian philosophy, Includes a passage in ancient Greek, Addresses reception of work and his critics: ""My enemies have, in one sense, deprived me of the privilege of thanking the publick for the favourable reception which have hitherto vouchsafed to give my works. If I thank them for it, 'tis a mark of my pride, and I only make a parade of my gratitude to trumpet my own praise. What answer can I make to this? If I undertake to justify myself, that's another instance of my vanity; for if I would be humble and modest in the sense which these gentlemn mean, I must suffer myself to be grosly abused, and to be critcised right or wrong, without shewing the least sign that I feel it. [...] I have computed the pamphlets that have been wrote against me for a year past, and they are no less than two and thirty, which is a circumstance I ought to be proud of [...] 'Tis unlucky for me that all these little satires die as soon as they peep out o the press, which is a very sad affair; and I am vastly sorry that the criticisms upon my works perish so soon."", Responds in particular to the failed critical periodical, the New Censor: ""Really this is a strange world we live in, which does not do justice to good thiings, but by tis contempt discourages the greatest geniuses; else how came that learned and eloquent pamphlet to be despised, which tho' written b one person only, might be look'd upon as the work of several who clubb'd their thoughts and reflections, which the principal author only put together."", Argues for the professionalization of imaginative writing that empowers the author rather than the bookseller/proprietor: ""Several of [the booksellers in Holland] have had my works, and not one can say that I have not acted with all the frankness and candour in the world. How many authors are there that can say this? I leave it to the booksellers themselves to declare it. AFter all, I don't think it any more disparaging to an author to receive a modest salary for his works, than for an advocate to take a fee for his pleadings, [...]. Those authors are mercenary, who working merely for bread, and being slaves to their employers, are nothing more than machines equipp'd with a pen, which is exercised just as a bookseller puts the springs in motion."", Points to popular reception of English translation of Lettres juives as incentive for translating and printing Chinese letter: ""The good success of that work has encouraged us to publish another, written by the same author, and in the sam etaste, which we hardly doubt of being as well relish'd as the former, since the author's reputation seems already to bespeak its acceptance."", Organized alphabetically, Keywords include names, latin phrases, places, concepts [i.e. Adultery, the inclination fo the French to that sin, 143], ""FINIS"" is printed not at the end of the letters but here, at the end of the index",0,Epistolary,,Verse,0,0,Translation,Lettres juives,"Letter, Correspondence, Traveller, Countryman, Original, French, Marquis, Author, Jewish Spy, English","Chinese, Philosophical, Historical, Critical","Paris, China, Muscovy, Persia, Japan",Marquis d'Argens,"Be, Translate, Do",,,AFD 07/19/2012 Swarthmore College,,,,

Attunes judgement of the following work within a discursive context of novels and literature more generally: Scarcely are authors able to ""muster courage sufficient to detail facts"" without charges of fictionality. Yet such charges are not detrimental, because novels can still effectively impart moral lessons and have anyhow seemed to be more popular with readers than their journalistic counterparts detailing the ""exhibition value"" of ""homogenous, empty time."" The author ""lays no claim to literary merit""--""hence it will afford no food for the critic""--going so far as to deny the work status ""as a specimen of proficiency,"" at least ""in the ordinary story telling of the day."" [Cf. B. Anderson, Imagined Communities, 1983; W. Benjamin, ""The Work of Art...,"" ""Theses.""], Work self-describes as allegory for cultural intervention: ""It claims only to be a brief story, devoid of prolixity and unnecessary detail. Its object is a pure one, being merely to warn the inexperienced female [...] of the deceiver, who, by his protestations of love and devotion, is secretly and inhumanly laying the plot which shall ultimately prove their ruin [...] by a relation of events in which an amiable young lady became deeply interested, and whose fortunes and fate are developed from chapter to chapter."", Claims nonfictionality vis-a-vis generic referentiality (homogenous, empty, subjunctive identification): ""Many who read the story may be able to recall to mind some who may have been placed in similar circumstances, and who may have met with a death equally premature and lamentable.

Every thing, that he undertakes has somewhat of the marvellous belonging to it [Here, suggests that readers can identify what is ""marvellous"" or what we might now call fictional--a bit larger than life, yet believably real--but do not fully recognize the work as fiction because of prefatory legitimacy claims]. In this Rome opens her bosom to him, and discovers all her treasures; in his Paysanne Parvenue* [Footnote: *A celebrate Novel of the same Author's, that has been miserably murder'd, under the Title of the Fortunate Country Maid.], a Marchioness of the first rank, intrusts him with her secrets; and in his Mentor a-la-Mode, he entertains us with analogies, which have never been though on by any body but himself: And, the first opportunity, he will palm upon us, with the same confidence, some new flights of his imagination, and will give us to understand, that they are to have the greater regard paid to them, on account of some such mystery miraculously brought to light. Such are the censures I must expect from them [who is ""them""? readers? critics?]: What, then, must I do in this cafe? I cannot compel them to believe me; nothing is more free than thought; and were I in their stead, perhaps, I should say more. The publick are to be our judge; and, to pass sentence on all the works of nature: Were I desirous of pre-possessing them in my favour, I would here make an encomium upon their equity; but what would this avail me? I should acquaint them with nothing new, and they would not be a jot the less severe in their criticisms. As for falling upon my knees and asking their pardon, in a preface, as a learned man* [Footnote: *Monsieur Boileau.] says upon this head, I am their very humble servant; and renounce their favour, at this mortifying price. But let us leave vain reflections; frequently arising from the pleasure of talking of one's self; which is a vanity common to almost all authors: let us endeavour not to imitate them, and return to our subject."", Provides narrative of the history of this manuscript: how it was first found under the foundations of a house in Rome by a mason and eventually ended up in Paris, where it was sold to the translator, Explains that the manuscript was in Italian but to the ""surprize"" of the translator, ""the scene laid at Paris"", Explains editorial practices: ""I did not think it material to alter the false names that are assumed therein, because that was of no great importance; but, as there are some satyrical passages, against persons in power, at the time when it was written, and the scene being laid at Paris, some persons might have made false applications thereof, I have omitted them, as well as several monstrous, and extraordinary stories, hardly to be believ'd, and too differnet from the customs of these times."", Footnotes in preface, Footnotes, In Chapter V of Part II, Provide historical information, Unclear as to whether it is the voice of M.

I: ""We do not pretend here to make an apology for this second volume; but we cannot help giving our readers notice, that the incidents, wherewith it abounds, are sufficiently affect, and the descriptions sufficiently lively, to be read with some eagerness."", Sets out a model for critical and complete reading, while suggesting that a book can only be as instructive or useful as the reader allows it: ""What we said, about the earnestness, wherewith it is usual to peruse any book of amusement, is, to induce our readers not to be like a man, whose voracious appetite makes him eat his victuals without chewing it [...]. Consideration is the palate, which tastes and digests the sentiments which fall in its way; and the longer they remain impress'd upon the mind, the more advantage we derive from thence; it is not enough to read what is agreeable with pleasure, we ought not to forget what is useful."", Borges and Gerard Genette were not the first to analogize paratext to vestibules/entryways: ""This is what we thought necessary to premise, in relation to our first volume, and we hope, together with the perusal of this, will be a full answer to all that has been alledged aobut it; we shall not, therefore, detain our readers any longer in the porch, but refer them to the parts following, which will enable them to judge for themselves.",0,First-person,Letters,,0,0,,,"Busy-body, Spy, History, Mons., Man, Rashness, Faculty, Obscurity, Fortune, Story, Whole, Variety, Adventure, Vol.","Successful, Entertaining, Infinitely, Inquisitive, Enterprising, Unhappy, Lowest, Most, Splendid, Several, Humorous, Great, Equally, Instructive, Diverting",,Mons.

Last digit seems to correspond to volume number., ""University of Pennsylvania Library"" embossed in title page in  v.1-4, v.6-8., Each volume has a frontispiece designed and drawn by Samuel Wale and engraved by Isaac Taylor., Sideways text in a poem on page 308 volume 5., Manicules used extensively from page 30 to 46 to mark Lovelace's comments on Anna Howe's letter.","Poem, Preface, List of characters, Footnotes, Footnotes, Footnotes, Footnotes, Footnotes, Note, Table of contents, Conclusion, Postscript, Poem","First line: ""O master of the heart! whose magic skill""., Sonnet (mostly) in ABBA rhyme scheme praising Richardson for the emotion he inspires in readers, his ability to ""lead our Youth to Good,"" and his accurate depiction of the ""ways of men""., ""At each distressful stroke their [readers'] true tears run"", First line: ""The following history is given in a series of letters written principally in a double yet separate correspondence;""., One purpose of the book: ""To warn children against preferring a man of pleasure to a man of probity, upon that dangerous but too commonly-received notion, That a reformed rake makes the best husband"" (x)., Responds to readers' responses: ""Different persons, as might be expected, have been of different opinions, in relation to the conduct of the heroine in particular situations; and several worthy persons have objected to the general catastrophe, and other parts of the history. Whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of postscript"" (xi)., First line: ""Miss Clarissa Harlowe, a young lady of great beauty and merit."", Footnotes helping the reader navigate through the text by providing background information on characters and situations; giving interpretations of scenes; explaining the formatting, inclusion, and exclusion of letters; and referring readers to relevant other sections of the text, often through reference to letter and page numbers., Footnotes citing other texts referenced in or relevant to the letters., Footnote in v.4, p. 334 refers the reader to a particular letter in Pamela for further discussion of ""the important subject of mothers being nurses to their own children."", Footnotes addressing actual or anticipated reader responses and criticisms. Often, Richardson argues against a particular interpretation of his text, using reference to specific passages and events to support his reading., Example: ""Clarissa has been censured as behaving to Mr. Lovelace, in their first conversation at St. Albans, and afterwards, with too much reserve, and even with haughtiness. Surely those who have thought her to blame on this account, have not paid a due attention to the story"" (v.3, p. 14). Richardson goes on to give a reading of the scene in which the note appears to support this point, and cites a later letter (identified by its number) for further evidence., Footnote by a character (e.g. v.5, pp. 86, 99, 104; v.7, pp. 103-4, 392). (The first of these footnotes has footnotes by Richardson.), Didactic footnotes instructing readers to pay particular attention to sections of the text from which important moral or practical lessons can be drawn, or spelling out the lesson Richardson wishes readers to take away from a particular section. For example, one note quotes several Bible verses on marriage law which Richardson says are ""highly necessary to be known"", especially for women who may be tricked into false marriages by their suitors (v.2, pp. 298-90). Another instructs ""such of the fair sex as are more apt to read for the sake of amusement, than instruction"" to pay particular attention to a letter (v.3, p. 79)., Occasional sections referring readers to other letters (similar to the footnotes) are inserted into the body of the text. Sometimes notes describe the context in which parts of letters were written or physical details about the letters, for example: ""_Under the superscription, written with a pencil, after she went down_"" (v.2, p. 238). At other points, they summarize letters that supposedly exist but are being omitted: ""Mr. Lovelace [...] gives an account to his friend (pretty much to the same effect with the Lady's) [...] of all that passed between them at the Inns [...] To avoid repetition, those passages in his narrative are only extracted, which will serve to embellish hers"" (v.3, p. 49)., First lines: ""Lett. I. Miss Howe, to Miss Clarissa Harlowe. Desires from her the particulars of the Rencounter between Mr. Lovelace and her Brother [...]"", Gives the letter number then a summary of its contents. Sometimes summarizes multiple letters together., Omitted from v.2., First line: ""What remains to be mentioned for the satisfaction of such of the readers as may be presumed to have interested themselves in the fortunes of those other principals in the story, who survived Mr. Lovelace, will be found summarily related as follows:""., Goes through character by character and describes what happens to them after the narrative ends., First line: ""The foregoing work having been published at three different periods of time, the author, in the course of its publication, was favoured with many anonymous letters, in which the writers differently expressed their wishes with regard to the apprehended catastrophe., First lines: ""If, 'mid their round of pleasure, to convey/An useful lesson to the young and gay;",0,Epistolary,Third-person,"Poems, Sheet music",0,1,,"Pamela, Sir Charles Grandison","History, Lady, Concern, Life, Author, Volume, Edition, Distress, Misconduct, Parent, Child, Relation, Marriage","Young, Important, Private, Eight, Sixth, Both",,"Clarissa, Mr. Richardson","Comprehend, Shew, Show, Attend",,"Most, Particularly",YDS 7/7/15 Swarthmore College GE,,,,

So that all their amours may be call'd gallantries, little Lambent flames, which never arrive at force enough to cause those raging emotions of desire, which constraint and difficulty create in Italy.

191125,"Lyttelton, George Lyttelton,",1709-1773.,Dialogues of the dead.,Dublin :,1760,Duodecimo,,"Published anonymously.  By George Lyttelton, Baron Lyttelton, with the exception of the last three dialogues which are by Elizabeth Montagu.  Cf. Halkett & Laing (2nd ed.), Bookplate-""Library of the University of Pennsylvania Given through the friends of the Library of the University of Pennsylvania by Mrs. John Frederick Lewis."", Elaborate inscription monogram on the recto of the first leaf., Misspelling and/or lack of pluralization in the running title: Dialogue, Diagloues, and Dialouges instead of Dialogues (p.32, 56, 90, 142, 224, 256), Library-related marginalia (numbers and letters in pencil). Title page (verso); first leaf of the preface (recto); last leaf of the text (verso)., The preface elevates and makes explicit the dialogues' fictionalization and dramatization of conversations between historical figures: ""...Dialogues written by Mr. Hurde are all supposed to have past between living persons. The plans I have followed takes in a much greater compass: it brings before us the history of all times and all nations, presents to the choice of the writer all characters of remarkable persons, which may best be opposed to or compared with each other; and is, perhaps, one of the most agreeable methods, that can be employed, of conveying to the mind any critical, moral, or political observations, because the dramatic spirit, which may be thrown into them, gives them more life, than they could have in dissertations, however well written."", A small design appears at the end of most dialogues; however, it is unclear whether or not they are booksellers' marks or more intentional illustrations.","Preface, Table of contents, Notes, Footnote, Footnote","Lucian among the Ancients, and among the Moderns Fenelon, Arch-bishop of Cambray, and Monsieur Fontenelle, have written Dialogues of the Dead with applause."", Provides list of Dialogues., These notes direct the reader to relevant information and are scattered throughout the dialogues in the second half of the book. A characteristic note — and also the first to appear in this text — reads ""See Plutarch's Life of Antony"" (Page 139) and is found in a dialogue between ""Octavia - Portia - Arria"". Octavia, of course, was the sister of Octavian, the future Augustus Caesar, and was married off to Marc Antony., This footnote provides a translation of the Italian which the author quotes in the preface. The footnote reads as follows: ""* If I have named Fate, Fortune, Destiny, Elysium, Styx, &c. they are only the Sports of a poetical Pen, not the Sentiments of a Catholick Mind."" (Page vii), ""N.B. This can't be properly called a Dialogue of the Dead; but there is one of the same kind among Cambray's Dialogues, between Ulysses and his companion Grillus, when turned to a Boar by the Enchantments of Circe, and two or three others, supposed to have passed between Persons alive.""

And should the creditor support on of the best of characters, be deservedly esteem'd by all who know him as a most worthy, benevolent, and friendly man, one of strict honour himself, and from thence naturally averse to any doubts concerning others, would not those be doubly culpable who left him to the disagreeable alternative of either fitting down with the loss to himself and family, or commencing a suit that be might be more painful to a man of good disposition? Suppose also, that previous notice had been given to the gentleman of his wife's design, could she, after having waited many weeks to give him time for his deliberation, be justly blamed for carrying that design into execution?

Clearly it is to the Marquess of Tavistock, who at that time would have been an eight year old boy, John Russell. However, if the dedication was written in 1771 but published only in 1772, his brother, Francis Russell, would have been Marquess rather than Duke, as their father would still be alive. Alternatively, it is not difficult to imagine the dedication being to a different Francis Russell, the Marquess who died in 1767, but would have had a distinguished career and thus been a more suitable subject for a dedication. I have written 700 entries for each of these people., This book is of questionable fictionality. The editor claims that the authors have merely disguised their names, and indeed, the book was written by a husband and wife of much the same positions in society as Henry and Frances.","To the booksellers, Letter, Letter, Footnotes, Preface, Dedication, Subscriber's List, Dedication, Preface, Dedication","Soon after the First edition was published in Ireland, the following letter appeared in Faulkner's Journal; the writer unknown."", ""The following criticism was sent to Henry by a friend of his."", ""Sir, I send you by the bearer a collection of the letters, which you complimented us so much upon, when you were last at my house; you should have had them before this, but my clerk had not finished them till yesterday."", ""I here present you with a genuine correspondence, which passed for several years, between a gentleman and lady of the kingdom of Ireland; though the scene has been laid in England, by the authors, when the first copy was made out, as they designed to keep themselves unknown, for reasons which may be collected from some of this address, and several passages in their letters."", ""My Lord, you will doubtless be surprized at an address from a man who declares himself a stranger to you, and to whom even your person is unknown."", ""There is not to be expected much connection among the following letters, as they in reality belong to the foregoing series; but, having no dates, were jostled out of their places when I was endeavoring to frame the suite from the subjects of the letters themselves."", ""To my sex, with what awe must I appear before so august an assembly, at whose tribunal the greatest potentates, with all the earthly powers that be, are wont to kneel!",1,Epistolary,Third-person,Poems,1,1,,,"Series, Letter, Edition, Author","Genuine, Third",,"Henry, Frances","Revise, Correct, Enlarge, Improve",Letter,,IH 7/7/2015 Swarthmore College NB,,,,

Whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of postscript"" (xi)., First line: ""Miss Clarissa Harlowe, a young lady of great beauty and merit."", Footnotes helping the reader navigate through the text by providing background information on characters and situations; giving interpretations of scenes; explaining the formatting, inclusion, and exclusion of letters; and referring readers to relevant other sections of the text, often through reference to letter and page numbers., Footnotes citing other texts referenced in or relevant to the letters., Footnote in v.4, p. 334 refers the reader to a particular letter in Pamela for further discussion of ""the important subject of mothers being nurses to their own children."", Footnotes addressing actual or anticipated reader responses and criticisms. Often, Richardson argues against a particular interpretation of his text, using reference to specific passages and events to support his reading., Example: ""Clarissa has been censured as behaving to Mr. Lovelace, in their first conversation at St. Albans, and afterwards, with too much reserve, and even with haughtiness. Surely those who have thought her to blame on this account, have not paid a due attention to the story"" (v.3, p. 14). Richardson goes on to give a reading of the scene in which the note appears to support this point, and cites a later letter (identified by its number) for further evidence., Footnote by a character (e.g. v.5, pp. 86, 99, 104; v.7, pp. 103-4, 392). (The first of these footnotes has footnotes by Richardson.), Didactic footnotes instructing readers to pay particular attention to sections of the text from which important moral or practical lessons can be drawn, or spelling out the lesson Richardson wishes readers to take away from a particular section. For example, one note quotes several Bible verses on marriage law which Richardson says are ""highly necessary to be known"", especially for women who may be tricked into false marriages by their suitors (v.2, pp. 298-90). Another instructs ""such of the fair sex as are more apt to read for the sake of amusement, than instruction"" to pay particular attention to a letter (v.3, p. 79)., Occasional sections referring readers to other letters (similar to the footnotes) are inserted into the body of the text. Sometimes notes describe the context in which parts of letters were written or physical details about the letters, for example: ""_Under the superscription, written with a pencil, after she went down_"" (v.2, p. 238). At other points, they summarize letters that supposedly exist but are being omitted: ""Mr. Lovelace [...] gives an account to his friend (pretty much to the same effect with the Lady's) [...] of all that passed between them at the Inns [...] To avoid repetition, those passages in his narrative are only extracted, which will serve to embellish hers"" (v.3, p. 49)., First lines: ""Lett. I. Miss Howe, to Miss Clarissa Harlowe. Desires from her the particulars of the Rencounter between Mr. Lovelace and her Brother [...]"", Gives the letter number then a summary of its contents. Sometimes summarizes multiple letters together., Omitted from v.2., First line: ""What remains to be mentioned for the satisfaction of such of the readers as may be presumed to have interested themselves in the fortunes of those other principals in the story, who survived Mr. Lovelace, will be found summarily related as follows:""., Goes through character by character and describes what happens to them after the narrative ends., First line: ""The foregoing work having been published at three different periods of time, the author, in the course of its publication, was favoured with many anonymous letters, in which the writers differently expressed their wishes with regard to the apprehended catastrophe., First lines: ""If, 'mid their round of pleasure, to convey/An useful lesson to the young and gay;",0,Epistolary,Third-person,"Poems, Sheet music",0,1,,"Pamela, Sir Charles Grandison","History, Lady, Concern, Life, Author, Volume, Edition, Distress, Misconduct, Parent, Child, Relation, Marriage","Young, Important, Private, Eight, Sixth, Both",,"Clarissa, Mr. Richardson","Comprehend, Shew, Show, Attend",,"Most, Particularly",YDS 7/7/15 Swarthmore College GE,,,,

The French performances of this nature are generally slight, trifling, and little acquainted with nature, except in the expression of the passions, and surprising incidents of intrigue...the free conversation of the women of France makes the success more easy, and the passion by consequence less violent. So that all their amours may be call'd gallantries, little Lambent flames, which never arrive at force enough to cause those raging emotions of desire, which constraint and difficulty create in Italy. This has furnish'd Aeneas Sylvius with the opportunity of giving us the lineaments of passion, which we can only find in the ancients, and which the French authors are little acquainted with."", Preface ""The history of the amours of Count Schlick"" makes truth claim: ""There is another advantage which our author has above the monsieurs, in writing on a real not fictitious story...it is plain from a passage in his epistle dedicatory to the Count of Schlick that he drew his picture from the true adventures of that lord."", Library markings, a2r., Title page (""Earl of Douglas"") detached.","Dedication, Preface","Located front of Earl of Douglas.

And should the creditor support on of the best of characters, be deservedly esteem'd by all who know him as a most worthy, benevolent, and friendly man, one of strict honour himself, and from thence naturally averse to any doubts concerning others, would not those be doubly culpable who left him to the disagreeable alternative of either fitting down with the loss to himself and family, or commencing a suit that be might be more painful to a man of good disposition? Suppose also, that previous notice had been given to the gentleman of his wife's design, could she, after having waited many weeks to give him time for his deliberation, be justly blamed for carrying that design into execution?

Clearly it is to the Marquess of Tavistock, who at that time would have been an eight year old boy, John Russell. However, if the dedication was written in 1771 but published only in 1772, his brother, Francis Russell, would have been Marquess rather than Duke, as their father would still be alive. Alternatively, it is not difficult to imagine the dedication being to a different Francis Russell, the Marquess who died in 1767, but would have had a distinguished career and thus been a more suitable subject for a dedication. I have written 700 entries for each of these people., This book is of questionable fictionality. The editor claims that the authors have merely disguised their names, and indeed, the book was written by a husband and wife of much the same positions in society as Henry and Frances.","To the booksellers, Letter, Letter, Footnotes, Preface, Dedication, Subscriber's List, Dedication, Preface, Dedication","Soon after the First edition was published in Ireland, the following letter appeared in Faulkner's Journal; the writer unknown."", ""The following criticism was sent to Henry by a friend of his."", ""Sir, I send you by the bearer a collection of the letters, which you complimented us so much upon, when you were last at my house; you should have had them before this, but my clerk had not finished them till yesterday."", ""I here present you with a genuine correspondence, which passed for several years, between a gentleman and lady of the kingdom of Ireland; though the scene has been laid in England, by the authors, when the first copy was made out, as they designed to keep themselves unknown, for reasons which may be collected from some of this address, and several passages in their letters."", ""My Lord, you will doubtless be surprized at an address from a man who declares himself a stranger to you, and to whom even your person is unknown."", ""There is not to be expected much connection among the following letters, as they in reality belong to the foregoing series; but, having no dates, were jostled out of their places when I was endeavoring to frame the suite from the subjects of the letters themselves."", ""To my sex, with what awe must I appear before so august an assembly, at whose tribunal the greatest potentates, with all the earthly powers that be, are wont to kneel!",1,Epistolary,Third-person,Poems,1,1,,,"Series, Letter, Edition, Author","Genuine, Third",,"Henry, Frances","Revise, Correct, Enlarge, Improve",Letter,,IH 7/7/2015 Swarthmore College NB,,,,

To satisfy his curiosity, I am to inform him, that they were given me by Mr. Cleveland, the author's son, a person advanced in years... He first shewed me his father's papers, which gave me so much pleasure and satisfaction, that I was very urgent to have them printed...
